            form the backbone of quantum research, bridging the gap between theoretical advancements
            and practical implementations. The rapid evolution of quantum computing is
            revolutionizing how we tackle complex computational problems, offering exponential
            speedups for optimization, simulation, and cryptography. Despite these advances,
            realizing the full potential of quantum computing requires breakthroughs in system
            architecture, hardware-software co-design, real-time error correction, and scalable
            quantum-classical integration.

            >Beyond algorithmic improvements, quantum computing demands robust system-level
            solutions that address the constraints of noise, coherence time, and resource
            allocation. Unlike traditional computing paradigms, quantum systems require novel
            approaches in compiler design, workload scheduling, and hybrid execution models to
            optimize performance across various quantum hardware platforms. As the field expands,
            interdisciplinary efforts are crucial to refining quantum control, error mitigation
            strategies, and interfacing quantum processors with classical infrastructure.

            This workshop aims to push the boundaries of computing system research for quantum
            technologies by exploring system architectures, software frameworks, compiler
            optimizations, quantum networking, and scalable implementations of mobile computing
            research in the context of quantum. Moving beyond isolated advancements, we seek to
            foster collaboration across computing system researchers, quantum physicists, and
            AI-driven optimization experts to advance the field toward practical, real-world
            deployment.

            >Quantum computing research is gaining momentum across major computing conferences
            (e.g., MICRO, ISCA, ASPLOS, and others), yet a focused forum on how relevant years of
            mobile computing research could contribute to this timely direction remains unclear. For
            the first time, a computing workshop on quantum will be organized at a SIGMobile
            conference. We believe this initiative will provide a platform for researchers and
            developers from academia and industry to connect, exchange ideas, and accelerate
            progress in quantum computing infrastructure. This workshop offers a timely opportunity
            to cultivate a growing research community dedicated to addressing the most pressing
            system challenges in quantum computing, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and
            defining the next frontiers of computing system research for quantum.

        Quantum computing is reshaping computational paradigms by addressing problems in
        optimization, cryptography, and material science that remain intractable for classical
        systems. While algorithmic breakthroughs have demonstrated theoretical advantages, realizing
        practical quantum computation demands system-level innovations in hardware, software, and
        hybrid execution models.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unique constraints of quantum systems — including noise, decoherence, and
        resource-intensive error correction — necessitate a rethinking of system architectures,
        scheduling frameworks, and quantum-classical integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critical challenges include mitigating decoherence while maintaining computational fidelity,
        optimizing compilers and execution pipelines for quantum workflows, designing scalable
        interconnects and memory architectures, and developing robust fault-tolerant mechanisms.
        These issues require interdisciplinary efforts spanning physics, computer architecture, and
        algorithm design to enable practical, scalable quantum systems.

        This workshop will explore advances in quantum computing infrastructure, addressing
        challenges in system design, resource management, and quantum networking. By convening
        experts from academia and industry, it aims to define research priorities, foster
        collaboration, and accelerate the development of system-level innovations that will drive
        quantum computing beyond theoretical promise into real-world impact.
