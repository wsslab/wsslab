# Abstract

This paper explores a wearable system, named Painometry, which objectively quanti!es users’ pain perception based-on multiple physiological signals and facial expressions of pain. We propose a sensing technique, called sweep impedance pro!ling (SIP), to capture the movement of the facial muscle corrugator supercilii, one of the important physiological expressions of pain. We deploy SIP together with other biosignals, including electroencephalography (EEG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), and galvanic skin response (GSR) for pain quanti!cation
